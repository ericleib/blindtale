The acoustic models found in this package were trained from
telephone-quality audio data sampled at 16 kHz. The bandwidth used for
processing is similar to telephone bandwidth, as detailed below. The
models are continuous, with 5725 senones, 22 gaussians per state. They
can be used with Sphinx-3 or Sphinx-4.

The acoustic models were trained with the following settings:

-feat 1s_c_d_dd
-agc max
-cmn current
-varnorm no 
-samprate 16000
-lowerf 440
-upperf 3500
-nfilt 31
-nfft 512
